aioeventlet implements the asyncio API (PEP 3156) on top of eventlet. It makes
possible to write asyncio code in a project currently written for eventlet.

aioeventlet allows to use greenthreads in asyncio coroutines, and to use
asyncio coroutines, tasks and futures in greenthreads: see ``link_future()``
and ``wrap_greenthread()`` functions.

The main visible difference between aioeventlet and trollius is the behaviour
of ``run_forever()``: ``run_forever()`` blocks with trollius, whereas it runs
in a greenthread with aioeventlet. It means that aioeventlet event loop can run
in an greenthread while the Python main thread runs other greenthreads in
parallel.
