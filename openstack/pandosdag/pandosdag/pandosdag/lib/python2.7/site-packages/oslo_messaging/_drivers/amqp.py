# this connection can be used for two purposes:
# * wait and receive amqp messages (only do read stuffs on the socket)
# * send messages to the broker (only do write stuffs on the socket)
# The code inside a connection class is not concurrency safe.
# Using one Connection class instance for doing both, will result
# of eventlet complaining of multiple greenthreads that read/write the
# same fd concurrently... because 'send' and 'listen' run in different
# greenthread.
# So, a connection cannot be shared between thread/greenthread and
# this two variables permit to define the purpose of the connection
# to allow drivers to add special handling if needed (like heatbeat).
# amqp drivers create 3 kind of connections:
# * driver.listen*(): each call create a new 'PURPOSE_LISTEN' connection
# * driver.send*(): a pool of 'PURPOSE_SEND' connections is used
# * driver internally have another 'PURPOSE_LISTEN' connection dedicated
#   to wait replies of rpc call
